# Module3 - Project14 

# Checklist 

# PART ONE - FORK & PULL REQUEST:
One student (here by referred to as The Mother) creates a repository with a few files
For example readme.md, index.html, style.css and main.js
The other students then do the following:
Fork the repository (on the GitHub page)
Clone the code from your own GitHub repository (the fork)
Make some interesting changes to the code
Push the new code to your own repository
Make a pull request on the GitHub website
The Mother now needs to accept the changes on the website too
# PART TWO - BRANCES:
Now The Mother needs to invite all the other students as collaborators to the repository
The students will then receive an email where they need to accept the collaboration
The students will then need to do the following:
Clone the mothers repository (not the fork) to their own computer
Make a new branch in the recently cloned repository
Make sure that you are working on the new branch
Make some changes to the code
Switch to master (or main) branch
Observe that your changes are not there anymore
Merge the new branch into master/main
Push the new code to GitHub
Observe the new code in GitHub
Now make a new branch again and make sure you are working on it
Make some changes to the code again.
Push the code by using git push origin xxxxxx where xxxxxx is the name of your branch
The Mother now needs to do the following:
Pull the new changes and check out the new branches from the other students
Observe that the changes are there each time you check out a new branch
Check out the master/main branch
Merge the other branches into master/main
Push the code to GitHub
